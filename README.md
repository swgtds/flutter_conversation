# CometChat Integration on FLutter

This project includes the integration of the **Conversation List + Message View** layout using the [CometChat Flutter UI Kit](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/ui-kit/flutter/flutter-conversation).

The Conversation List + Message View layout provides a seamless two-panel chat interface, commonly seen in modern messaging apps like WhatsApp Web, Slack, and Microsoft Teams.
It allows users to switch between conversations while keeping the active chat open, delivering a smooth, real-time messaging experience.
